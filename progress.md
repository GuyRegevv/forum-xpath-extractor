## Stage Checklist

- [x] Stage 1 — renderer.py (test: HTML length logs for both URLs)
- [x] Stage 2 — sanitizer.py (test: reduction ratio — altenens 78.6%, blackbiz 90.8%)
- [x] Stage 3 — ie_extractor.py (test: extracted JSON for both URLs — both PASSED)
- [ ] Stage 4 — condenser.py (test: condensed HTML has class names)
- [ ] Stage 5 — xpath_generator.py (test: full loop on both URLs)
- [ ] Stage 6 — formatter.py (test: JSON output + console display)
- [ ] main.py — entry point wiring all stages
- [ ] requirements.txt
- [ ] .gitignore
- [ ] README.md

## End-to-End Test
- [ ] `python main.py https://altenens.is/whats-new/posts/` produces correct output
- [ ] `python main.py https://s1.blackbiz.store/whats-new` produces correct output

## Decisions Made
- Dependencies installed into `.venv/` (Python 3.13) due to Homebrew PEP 668 restriction — use `.venv/bin/pytest` to run tests
- `env.example` renamed to `.env.example` to match CLAUDE.md docs
- `_NAVIGATION_TIMEOUT_MS = 30_000` constant extracted (used for both networkidle and domcontentloaded fallback)
- `PlaywrightError` (base class) caught and wrapped in `PageRenderError` to cover network-unreachable errors (spec requirement that was missing from the plan)

## Issues Encountered
- System Python (3.14, Homebrew-managed) rejects global pip installs per PEP 668 — solved by creating `.venv`
- `PlaywrightTimeoutError` import was transiently removed in a cleanup commit then re-added in Task 4 — no functional impact

## Session Notes
Session 2026-05-03: Implemented Stage 1 end-to-end using subagent-driven development.
- 7 commits, 16 unit tests + 2 integration tests, all passing
- Integration tests confirmed: altenens.is=118 KB, blackbiz.store=142 KB

Session 2026-05-04: Implemented Stage 2 end-to-end using subagent-driven development.
- 6 commits (66386ff → e41e4fb), 24 unit tests + 2 integration tests, all passing
- Integration tests: altenens.is 117.5 KB → 25.1 KB (78.6%), blackbiz.store 142.6 KB → 13.1 KB (90.8%)

Session 2026-05-05: Implemented Stage 3 end-to-end using inline execution.
- 5 commits (6a667fe → 9d4b373), 14 unit tests + 2 integration tests, all passing
- Integration tests: altenens.is extracted title/author/date/link ✓, blackbiz.store ✓
- Key decision: link.value falls back to title text when href stripped — code-level fallback added
- Resume: start Stage 4 with `condenser.py` — use `/superpowers:writing-plans`
